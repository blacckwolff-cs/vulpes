# 1. Introduction & Philosophy

## What is Vulpes?

> **Vulpes is a low-level language wearing a high-level language’s name tag.**
>
> The project began when I saw classmates wrestle with the redundant complexity of C and C++—from vector supremacy and over-glorified containers to the nitpicking of preprocessors and endless include statements. Rust fixed much of what I hated about C++, but its learning curve was a wall, and writing code in it felt icky and alienating.  
> 
> As I wrote in other languages, I kept track of what I loved, hated, and wished for. Vulpes is the result: a language that takes the best of C, C++, Python, Lua, and Rust, but is never afraid to do its own thing.

## Who is Vulpes for?

> **Anyone and everyone who needs a language that adapts to their project, not the other way around.**  
> With its “companion” build system, Foxhole, Vulpes is a *one-size-fits-all* language that doesn’t sacrifice its soul to get there.  
> Whether you’re building scripts, tools, libraries, or executables, Vulpes aims to offer power without the pain.

## Why Vulpes? What makes it different?

- **No more redundancy:** Vulpes banishes boilerplate, unnecessary ceremony, and over-complicated concepts.
- **Pragmatic, not precious:** The design is guided by what *works*—no over-glorification of any single paradigm.
- **Everything is composable:** From variables to functions to types, Vulpes unifies and simplifies.
- **Friendly, but not shallow:** Fast to learn, but deep enough for pros.
- **Opinionated error messages:** You won’t spend hours decoding cryptic stack traces or weird compiler errors.

## The Four Core Files of Vulpes

| File Type | Extension | Description                                              |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source**    | `.vlp`    | Human-readable code. Write, read, and compile here.   |
| **Binary**    | `.fox`    | Executable output—fast, efficient, portable.          |
| **Kit**       | `.kit`    | Project config, like `.toml`, for builds and packages.|
| **Hole**      | `.hole`   | Vulpes-native structured data (like JSON, but better).|

**In short:**  
*Vulpes is what C++ could have been, what Rust wanted to be, and what Python makes you wish you had—  
but it’s all in one language.*
