# 17. Roadmap & Vision

Vulpes is just getting started. Here’s where we’re headed—and how you can help shape the language.

---

## 17.1 Philosophy

- **Accessible systems programming:**  
  Vulpes aims to bring the power of C, C++, and Rust to everyone—without the footguns or steep learning curve.
- **Zero surprises:**  
  Syntax, semantics, and tooling are designed to be clear, explicit, and easy to reason about.
- **“Batteries included, footguns removed”:**  
  A practical, expressive standard library, powerful error handling, and first-class tooling.
- **Community-driven:**  
  Feedback, ideas, and contributions are always welcome.

---

## 17.2 Immediate Priorities

- Complete the core language implementation (compiler, VM, and parser/lexer).
- Finalize the Foxhole build system and package registry.
- Stabilize standard library modules (`io`, `math`, `str`, `array`, `graphics`, etc.).
- Robust error reporting and developer tooling (formatter, linter, doc generator).
- Official VSCode extension and language server.
- Design and implement opt-in garbage collection and pointer flavors.

---

## 17.3 Near-term Goals

- Cross-platform standard library support (Windows, Linux, Mac).
- Async/await and concurrency primitives.
- Rich collections (`vec`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, etc.).
- Raylib-inspired graphics/audio APIs for game and creative coding.
- Reflection, macros, and attribute trinket expansion.
- Ecosystem: docs site, package index, forums, and real-world tutorials.

---

## 17.4 Mid- to Long-term Vision

- Compile-to-native code (self-hosted, with JIT/AOT options).
- Advanced debugging: breakpoints, watches, step-by-step tracing, profiler.
- Hot reload and scripting for games and live tools.
- WebAssembly and embedded support.
- Seamless FFI (calling C/C++/Rust/Python from Vulpes).
- Internationalization and accessibility features.
- Community-driven governance and transparent RFC process.

---

## 17.5 How to Get Involved

- Try out the language and send feedback.
- File bug reports and feature requests.
- Contribute code, tests, docs, and examples.
- Join the Discord, forum, or GitHub Discussions to share ideas.
- Help shape the language—Vulpes is *by* and *for* its users.

> **Summary:**  
> Vulpes is moving fast, with big plans—join us in making a language that’s truly “Nine Tails Ahead.”
